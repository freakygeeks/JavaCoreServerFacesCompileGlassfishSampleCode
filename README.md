This is my compile code based on sample code in Java Core Server Faces 2nd Edition book using a Glassfish server.

NONE of the code in the repository is created by me. I'm just typed it, compiled it and run it to see the result from the code given by the author.

For those who got an error when compiling, you can download and run my already compile war file in this repository.
